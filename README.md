Roblox android 32 bits. Got bored again.

Basically another script executor source.
this time using visual studio and with custom function support.
learning resource

you can see that its quite badly coded so i wouldn't recommend using it 
as your base or such.

going to actively work on it until i find something better to do.

# TODO
* Fix scriptable functions and hidden properties.
* Improve performance and stability.
* Clean up.
* Improve code.
* Add a better way to bypass the context system
* Fix taskscheduler functions getting old jobs.
* Add Http Functions
